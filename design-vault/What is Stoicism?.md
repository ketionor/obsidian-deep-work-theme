# Stoicism

**Stoicism** is a school of [Hellenistic philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_philosophy "Hellenistic philosophy") founded by [Zeno of Citium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium "Zeno of Citium") in Athens in the early 3rd century BC. It is a [[Philosophy]] of personal [ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics "Ethics") informed by its system of [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic") and its views on the natural world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to [eudaimonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia "Eudaimonia") (happiness, or blessedness) is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or by the fear of pain, by using one's mind to understand the world and to do one's part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and justly.

The Stoics are especially known for teaching that "[virtue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue "Virtue") is the only good" for human beings, and that external things—such as health, wealth, and pleasure—are not good or bad in themselves (_[adiaphora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiaphora "Adiaphora")_), but have value as "material for virtue to act upon." Alongside [Aristotelian ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelian_ethics "Aristotelian ethics"), the Stoic tradition forms one of the major founding approaches to [virtue ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtue_ethics "Virtue ethics").[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-1) The Stoics also held that certain destructive emotions resulted from errors of judgment, and they believed people should aim to maintain a will (called _[prohairesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohairesis "Prohairesis")_) that is "in accordance with [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(philosophy) "Nature (philosophy)")." Because of this, the Stoics thought the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said, but how a person behaved.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-2) To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they thought everything was rooted in nature.

Many Stoics—such as [Seneca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger "Seneca the Younger") and [Epictetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus "Epictetus")—emphasized that because "virtue is sufficient for [happiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_happiness "Philosophy of happiness")," a [sage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sage_(philosophy) "Sage (philosophy)") would be emotionally resilient to misfortune. This belief is similar to the meaning of the phrase "stoic calm," though the phrase does not include the "radical ethical" Stoic views that only a [sage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sage_(philosophy) "Sage (philosophy)") can be considered truly free, and that all moral corruptions are equally vicious.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-Stoicism-3)

Stoicism flourished throughout the [Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome "Ancient Rome") and [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Greece "Roman Greece") world until the 3rd century AD, and among its adherents was Emperor [Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius "Marcus Aurelius"). It experienced a decline after [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity "Christianity") became the state religion in the 4th century AD. Since then it has seen revivals, notably in the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_philosophy "Renaissance philosophy") ([Neostoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neostoicism "Neostoicism")) and in the contemporary era ([modern Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Stoicism "Modern Stoicism")).[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-4)

### Origins

Stoicism was originally known as "Zenonism", after the founder [Zeno of Citium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium "Zeno of Citium"). However, this name was soon dropped, likely because the Stoics did not consider their founders to be perfectly wise, and to avoid the risk of the philosophy becoming a [cult of personality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality "Cult of personality").[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-:1-5)

The name "Stoicism" derives from the [Stoa Poikile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoa_Poikile "Stoa Poikile") ([Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek"): ἡ ποικίλη στοά), or "painted porch", a colonnade decorated with mythic and historical battle scenes, on the north side of the [Agora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Agora_of_Athens "Ancient Agora of Athens") in [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens "Athens"), where Zeno and his followers gathered to discuss their ideas.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-etymologymerriam-6)[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-Williamson2015-7)

Sometimes Stoicism is therefore referred to as "The Stoa", or the philosophy of "The Porch".[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-:1-5)

### Modern usage

The word "stoic" commonly refers to someone who is indifferent to pain, pleasure, grief, or joy.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-8) The modern usage as a "person who represses feelings or endures patiently" was first cited in 1579 as a [noun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun "Noun") and in 1596 as an [adjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective "Adjective").[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-9) In contrast to the term "[Epicurean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicureanism "Epicureanism")", the _Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's_ entry on Stoicism notes, "the sense of the English adjective 'stoical' is not utterly misleading with regard to its philosophical origins."[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-10)

### Basic tenets

> Philosophy does not promise to secure anything external for man, otherwise it would be admitting something that lies beyond its proper subject-matter. For as the material of the carpenter is wood, and that of statuary bronze, so the subject-matter of the art of living is each person's own life.

The Stoics provided a unified account of the world, constructed from ideals of [logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic "Logic"), [monistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism "Monism") physics and [naturalistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalism_(philosophy) "Naturalism (philosophy)") ethics. Of these, they emphasized ethics as the main focus of human knowledge, though their logical theories were of more interest for later philosophers.

Stoicism teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive [emotions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion "Emotion"); the philosophy holds that becoming a clear and unbiased thinker allows one to understand the universal reason (_[logos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos "Logos")_). A primary aspect of Stoicism involves improving the individual's ethical and moral well-being: "_Virtue_ consists in a _will_ that is in agreement with Nature."[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-Russell-11) This principle also applies to the realm of interpersonal relationships; "to be free from anger, envy, and jealousy,"[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-Russell1-12) and to accept even slaves as "equals of other men, because all men alike are products of nature".[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-Russell5-13)

The Stoic ethic espouses a [deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism "Determinism") perspective; in regard to those who lack Stoic virtue, [Cleanthes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleanthes "Cleanthes") once opined that the wicked man is "like a dog tied to a cart, and compelled to go wherever it goes".[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-Russell-11) A Stoic of virtue, by contrast, would amend his will to suit the world and remain, in the words of Epictetus, "sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy,"[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-Russell1-12) thus positing a "completely autonomous" individual will, and at the same time a universe that is "a rigidly deterministic single whole". This viewpoint was later described as "[Classical Pantheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Pantheism "Classical Pantheism")" (and was adopted by Dutch philosopher [Baruch Spinoza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza "Baruch Spinoza")).[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-14)

Beginning around 301 BC, [Zeno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Citium "Zeno of Citium") taught philosophy at the [Stoa Poikile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoa_Poikile "Stoa Poikile") ("Painted Porch"), from which his philosophy got its name.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-15) Unlike the other schools of philosophy, such as the [Epicureans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicureans "Epicureans"), Zeno chose to teach his philosophy in a public space, which was a [colonnade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonnade "Colonnade") overlooking the central gathering place of Athens, the [Agora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Agora_of_Athens "Ancient Agora of Athens").

Zeno's ideas developed from those of the [Cynics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynicism_(philosophy) "Cynicism (philosophy)"), whose founding father, [Antisthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisthenes "Antisthenes"), had been a disciple of [Socrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates "Socrates"). Zeno's most influential follower was [Chrysippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysippus "Chrysippus"), who was responsible for the molding of what is now called Stoicism. Later Roman Stoics focused on promoting a life in harmony within the universe, over which one has no direct control.

Scholars usually divide the history of Stoicism into three phases:

*   Early Stoa, from the founding of the school by Zeno to [Antipater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipater_of_Tarsus "Antipater of Tarsus").
*   Middle Stoa, including [Panaetius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panaetius "Panaetius") and [Posidonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posidonius "Posidonius").
*   Late Stoa, including [Musonius Rufus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Musonius_Rufus "Gaius Musonius Rufus"), [Seneca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger "Seneca the Younger"), [Epictetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus "Epictetus"), and [Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius "Marcus Aurelius").

No complete works survive from the first two phases of Stoicism. Only Roman texts from the Late Stoa survive.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-16)

Stoicism became the foremost popular philosophy among the educated elite in the Hellenistic world and the Roman Empire,[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-17) to the point where, in the words of [Gilbert Murray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Murray "Gilbert Murray") "nearly all the [successors of Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diadochi "Diadochi") \[...\] professed themselves Stoics."[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism#cite_note-18)
